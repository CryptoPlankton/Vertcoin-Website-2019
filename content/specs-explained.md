Built on Bitcoin, receiving any future Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin/">updates</a> upon specification release confirmation.

<br><br>
Has the same block time (2.5 mins) as Litecoin and same supply of coins (84,000,000 coins).
<span style="opacity: 0.4; display: block;">These changes are well within scaling limits of blockchain growth and orphan generation (>1:30)</span>

<br><br>
Mining algorithm proposed is similar to Ethereum's Ethash (Verthash), meaning GPUs mine competitively.
<span style="opacity: 0.4; display: block;">This ensures maximum distribution of hashrate (security). It is done via IO bound memory constraints. Lyra2rev3 is currently in use.</span>

<br><br>
Difficulty adjustment occurs every block (~2.5 minutes) as opposed to Bitcoin (~2 weeks).
<span style="opacity: 0.4; display: block;">Kimoto Gravity Well is the algorithm used and is necessary as a smaller hashrate coin.</span>
