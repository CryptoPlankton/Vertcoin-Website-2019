Vertcoin had its first block back in Jan 2014. It was built <a href="https://github.com/vertcoin-project/vertcoin-core">using Bitcoin as a base</a>. 
<br><br>
Vertcoin was created as a GPU mined version of Bitcoin. This enables a greater spread of overall security long term compared to ASICs. If enough devices mine the network Vertcoin represents a viable alternative to the Bitcoin ASIC security model. 
<br><br>
Ethereum currently uses a mining algorithm similar to Verthash and <a href="https://howmanyconfs.com/" target="_blank">achieves security near that of Bitcoin</a>. It shows creating a dominant GPU profitable Bitcoin variant is possible.
<br><br>
Vertcoin is not funded nor controlled by any entity, it is simply an open source GPU Bitcoin variant that mirrors BTC development.
