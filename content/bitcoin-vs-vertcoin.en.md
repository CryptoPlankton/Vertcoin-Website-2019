Vertcoin had its first block back in Jan 2014. It was built <a href="https://github.com/vertcoin-project/vertcoin-core">using Bitcoin as a base</a>.

Vertcoin was created as a GPU mined version of Bitcoin. This enables a greater spread of overall security long term compared to ASICs. If enough devices mine the network, Vertcoin represents a viable alternative to the Bitcoin ASIC security model.
<br><br>
Ethereum currently uses a mining algorithm similar to Verthash and <a href="https://howmanyconfs.com/" target="_blank">achieves security near that of Bitcoin</a>. It shows creating a dominant GPU profitable Bitcoin variant is possible.

In an ideal world, this second spot in hashrate would be filled by a GPU Bitcoin derivative. It would serve as a meaningful competitor to Bitcoin with a legitimate point of difference.
