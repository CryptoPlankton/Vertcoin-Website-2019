Vertcoin had its first block back in Jan 2014. It was built <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/vtc/block.dws?9249c198d4b1ca38bb92a740d6557df80e746108384552509225e7825556ebdf.htm" target="_blank">using Bitcoin as a base</a>.

Vertcoin was created as a GPU mined version of Bitcoin. This enables a greater spread of overall security long term compared to ASICs. If enough devices mine the network, Vertcoin represents a viable alternative to the Bitcoin ASIC mined security model.
<br><br>

Ethereum currently uses a mining algorithm similar to the proposed Verthash mining algorithm and <a href="https://howmanyconfs.com/" target="_blank">achieves security near that of Bitcoin</a>, which means the task is achieveable.

In an ideal world, this second hashrate spot would be filled by a GPU Bitcoin derivative. It could serve as a meaningful competitor to Bitcoin with a legitimate point of difference.
